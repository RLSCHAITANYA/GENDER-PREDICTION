This is a modular machine learning pipeline that automates data ingestion, transformation, and model training. It starts by creating a virtual environment, logging errors, and selecting a diverse dataset. The pipeline then splits the data into training and testing sets, transforms categorical and numerical features, and trains a model using regression algorithms and hyperparameter tuning. The best model is saved as a pickle file and deployed on platforms like AWS,GCP and Azure. Finally, a user-friendly front-end interface is built using Flask to receive predictions. This pipeline is flexible, robust, and valuable for data scientists, researchers, and developers.
